Do you think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different  customers or products? You may edit a file named README in vi or nano or emacs to answer this question, as well as any other explanations you like to add. 


For customers, the helpfulness score would vary greatly. I believe how users gauge helpfulness here is very subjective and you would get wide ranging results. The MEAN helpfulness score is not that useful. 

For example, I was looking at one customer ID that reviewed 97 different books and one book has over 100 helpfulness score and other reviews only has 3,5,6 helpfulness score. So when you average it up, I don't think the value means anything.

For products the scores would vary less. I expect that higher scores (because of popularity) will be offset by higher number of reviews to divide from.
